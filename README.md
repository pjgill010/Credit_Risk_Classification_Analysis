# Credit_Risk_Classification_Analysis

## Summary
- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
- Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

##Question
- Question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
-- 94% accurate. High risk loans - recall is 89%. Should be higher.

- Question: How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
-- Answer: Accuracy has gone up. 94% up to 99%. Recall for high risk 89% up to 100%
